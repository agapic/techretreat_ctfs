      <h2>Landing Page</h2>
      <p>So there are three parts to a response: the status line, the headers,
        and the body. You were told that the body wasn't important. So look at
        the header (you can do this through your browser's developer tools),
        and you will see something like:</p>

      <pre><code>Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: 608
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 2015 14:26:53 GMT
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=99
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.11</code></pre>

      <p>Hmm, nothing too useful here. So let's look at the status line then.
        Great! It says <q>418 I'm a teapot</q>. So the answer is simply,
        <q>teapot</q>. Type it into the box and move on.</p>

      <h2>HAL Accepts</h2>
      <p>
        You needed to request the image with an http request header whose
        <code>Accept</code> value didn't contain <code>text/html</code>.
        Easiest way of doing this would be to edit the page using something
        like chrome's inspect-element and insert:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="./tipmeoverandpourmeout.png" /&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        while on the page (causing it to load itself as an image without the
        <code>text/html</code> accepts header).
      </p>

      <h2>What options do you have?</h2>
      <p>As is usual, first look up the italicized term in context. Googling
        <q>HTTP options</q> is a good start. We see that options is an accepted
        method of HTTP. So we should send an OPTIONS request. There are several
        ways to do this, but we'll use the browser because it requires no external
        tools.
      </p>

      <p>Open your console and make a new XHR request:</p>

      <pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('OPTIONS', 'youmayproceed.php');
xhr.send()</code></pre>

      <p>Then in the Network section of your browser's devtools, find the new
        OPTIONS request. There, the important header is ALLOW. You see that we
        can GET, REFRESH, or SOLUTION. Well we've already GET-ed (GOT?) the page
        and that wasn't too useful, and we don't really need to REFRESH, so
        let's try a SOLUTION request. Again with XHR:</p>

        <pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('SOLUTION', 'youmayproceed.php');
xhr.send()</code></pre>

      <p>This time if we look in our console we see we got a 204 No Content. Not
        to worry, though, as in the headers we see
        <code>Set-Cookie: youmayproceed=true</code>. Usually cookies are used
        for server-to-client communication, so let's just refresh the page and
        see if it works... and it does! So proceed to the next page.</p>

      <h2>Expires</h2>
      <p>
        This one's a reference to PHP developer Sascha Schumann, whose birthday is supposedly
        Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT. That's also the date that PHP sets the "Expires" header to
        if you're not supposed to cache the page.
      </p>

      <h2>PHP</h2>
      <p>
        PHP is an interesting language with many quirky features... to say the least.
        This challenge takes advantage of a few which don't seem to make sense
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>if (isset($_GET["referer"])) {</code></pre>
      <p>
        First, the website appears to have expected the 'referer' in the GET request.
        For those who don't know, GET is viewable in the address bar and comes in the form of
        http://somewebsite.com/somepage.php?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2&amp;key3=value3
      </p>
      <p>So, to get past this first error, simply set the 'referer' key to some value</p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>assert($_GET["referer"] == "weneedtogodeeper");</code></pre>
      <p>
        Oops. Right after that it appears that the website actually wants the value
        "weneedtogodeeper" as the referer. No problem. We'll just do exactly that
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>if (isset($_COOKIE["secret"])) {</code></pre>
      <p>
        Ok, so now the website wants a cookie called 'secret'.
        We can do that in Javascript from the URL bar or the developer console.
        Something like this would work fine
        <pre><code>document.cookie = "secret=asdf";</code></pre>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>assert(strpos($_COOKIE["secret"], " techretreat is awesome") !== FALSE);</code></pre>
      <p>
        We refresh the page to see the new error. It appears that the cookie must have the phrase
        " techretreat is awesome" in it. No problem. We'll just run some new Javascript:
        <pre><code>document.cookie = "secret=asdf techretreat is awesome";</code></pre>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>$magicnumber = 18 + $_COOKIE["secret"];
assert($magicnumber == 42);</code></pre>
      <p>
        So here we see the first interesting PHP quirk. If you try to convert a String to an integer,
        it'll parse the first number in the String, unless it doesn't start with a number.
        So the trick is to find what number adds with 18 to give 42, then prepend the cookie with that.
        You should end up with something like
        <pre><code>document.cookie = "24 techretreat is awesome";</code></pre>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>if (isset($_GET["cast"])) {</code></pre>
      <p>So the website is looking for a GET key called "cast". Let's give it one. I chose asdf again</p>
      <p>Remeber that any GET keys after the first will be delimited by an ampersand</p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>$magicvalue = (asdf) $magicnumber;
  assert($magicvalue == NULL);</code></pre>
      <p>
        It appears that the website is actually casting $magicnumber, which is 42, to whatever you give it.
        In this case, it's gone and cast to "asdf", which isn't actually legal.
        It looks like somehow, we need to make $magicvalue null, just by casting.
        Fortunately, after reading the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.null.php">docs</a>,
        we see that by casting to "unset", it will return a result of NULL. Cool
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>if (isset($_GET["firstnumber"]) &amp;&amp; isset($_GET["secondnumber"])) {</code></pre>
      <p>So we put add two more parameters to our GET request. There's really not much to say here</p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>assert($value1 - $value2 == 0 &amp;&amp; $value1 != $value2);</code></pre>
      <p>
        Weird. Somehow, we need to get two values who when subtracted from each other, equal zero,
        but when compared, they're not equal to each other. Fortunately, PHP can help with more quirks!
        Because Strings can't necessarily be 'subtracted', PHP will convert them to integers first.
        Recall that the integers will be pulled from the first number in the string, or 0 if it starts with a letter.
        That means we can give it any two strings that start with the same number, but end with some other letters.
        For example, "42tech" and "42retreat" work.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>//TODO: Fix bugs in code, link to next part cantthinkofagoodname.php
echo "That's all we got for now"</code></pre>
      <p>
        Looks like the author forgot a semicolon. Fortunately for us because the next part
        is linked in the comment. Looks like we're all done here.
      </p>

      <h2>Referer Spam</h2>
      <p>This is a coding challenge. (Or, you could cheat and use your browser's
      Find button, but there were several protections that made it hard to get
      right.)</p>

      <p>The following Javascript code easily solves the problem. It can be
        typed directly into the browser console. Understanding this code is left
        as a challenge for the reader.</p>

      <pre><code><!--
-->var relevant = [].slice.call(document.querySelector('pre').textContent.split('referer')[443]);
console.log(relevant.filter(function(x) {return 'a' &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 'z';}).slice(0, 5).join(''));<!--
--></code></pre>

      <p>For those of you who prefer an expressive, dynamic language like
        Python, one author has contributed the following code:</p>
      <pre><code><!--
-->import string
with open('raw.bin') as f:
    blob = f.read()
print("".join(c for c in blob.split('referer')[443] if c in string.ascii_lowercase)[:5])<!--
--></code></pre>

      <p>And finally, for those who prefer a performant, static language like
        C++, another author has contributed the following:</p>
      <pre><code><!--
-->#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

int main(){
    std::ifstream file("raw.php.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);
    if (file.is_open()){
        std::string contents, step2;
        std::size_t length = 0;

        // seek to end
        file.seekg(0, std::ios::end);
        // pre allocate file length in memory
        length = file.tellg();
        contents.resize(length);
        // seek to beginning
        file.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);
        // Read file
        file.read(&amp;contents[0], contents.size());
        file.close();

        std::size_t position = 0;
        for (unsigned int times = 0; times &lt; 443; ++times){
            position = contents.find("referer", position) + 7;
            //std::cout &lt;&lt; position &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }
        step2 = contents.substr(position, length - position);
        step2.erase(
            std::remove_if(
                step2.begin(),
                step2.end(),
                [](char x){
                    return !std::islower(x);
                }
            )
        );
        std::cout &lt;&lt; step2.substr(0, 5) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }else{
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Error: Could not open raw.php.txt" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}<!--

      <h2>Google</h2>
      <p>Not so fast! The leaderboard can only be accessed by a Google spider.
        Darn. But wait &mdash; how does the server know that we aren't google?
        Through the <code>User-Agent</code>, of course! We just need to spoof
        that. There are lots of browser extensions that will let you do this.
        Just spoof the user agent to something like
        <code>Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html)</code> and
        you're finally done!</p>
